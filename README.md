# Reinforcement Learning on Basketball

## Rough Overview (WIP) 
Agent learns the best angle 
and speed to shoot a basketball depending on the distance 
from the hoop and its own height.

The agent has two parameters:
 - Height
 - Distance from hoop

The model takes two inputs (player height, distance from hoop) and outputs two values (speed and angle to throw the ball). 

## TODO
- Implement training 
- Implement more variables
